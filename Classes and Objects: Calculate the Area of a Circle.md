# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
import math

class cse:
    def mech(self, radius):
        area = math.pi * radius ** 2
        return area

# Get user input
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

# Create an object of the class
circle = cse()

# Call the method and calculate the area
area = circle.mech(radius)

# Output the result
print("The area of the circle is:", area)
```

## Output
Enter the radius of the circle: 5  
The area of the circle is: 78.53981633974483

## Result
The program successfully calculates and prints the area of the circle using the radius provided by the user, with the calculation handled in the mech method of the cse class.
