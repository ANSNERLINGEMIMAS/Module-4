# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
# Define a list with some integer elements
list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Use try-except block to handle IndexError
try:
    print(list1[5])  # Try accessing an index out of range
except IndexError:
    print("You're out of list range")
```

## Output
You're out of list range


## Result
The program successfully handles the IndexError and prints the custom message when an attempt is made to access an index beyond the list's available range.
